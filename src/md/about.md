# Hi, I'm Michael Barrett

I completed a Master of Fine Arts at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I found my way into a software development career, working primarily as a front-end engineer but also working with web service and API development in Java, C#, and Python.

I have worked extensively with cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and has worked with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Lately, I likes to say ["JAMstack"](https://jamstack.org/) in meetings to see if anyone notices.

I prefer [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my JavaScript editor on macOS. I prefer [Procreate](https://procreate.art/) on the iPad for painting. I prefer [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) on macOS for creating web graphics. [PixelmatorPro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) is pretty nice too.

## This site

This site is like a sketchbook that keeps going and going. This site pulls snapshots, found images, and digital paintings into a long streaming grid of pictures. I cross post this grid on Instagram.

This site is a static website, created using the NextJS and ReactJS frameworks and hosted at Netlify. It should work reasonably well in modern browsers.

## Newsletter

I keep a newsletter at Substack. I perodically write about my art, work, life, and stuff I like.
