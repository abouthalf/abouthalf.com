# About this site

I'm Michael Barrett. I work as a software engineer (though I really prefer the term "developer") and my primary expertise is front-end web development, though I have lots of experience writing server-side code in a variety of languages inclucding JavaScript, Java, C#, and PHP.

I studied art in school and in the past couple of years I have re-discovered painting and drawing as a creative outlet.
