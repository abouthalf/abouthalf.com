# This is an art journal

This is an art journal where I share paintings, animations, and netart. I like to work with found images, my own snapshots, and digital paintings I create using an iPad and digital painting software. I like making art on the public internet where anyone can have it. I like using an inkjet printer as a printing press and making real things out of virtual images. 

I think a digital painting can be more than pixels on a screen. It can be responsive, filling its rectangular container. It can respond to your touch or your mouse.

## This site

This site is a static website, hand coded using the NextJS AND ReactJS frameworks. This site is hosted at Netlify. I prefer [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my JavaScript editor on macOS. I prefer [Procreate](https://procreate.art/) on the iPad for painting. I prefer [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) on macOS for creating web graphics. [PixelmatorPro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) is pretty nice too.
