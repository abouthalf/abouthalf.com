# This is an art journal

This is an art journal where I share paintings, animations, and netart. I like to work with found images, my own snapshots, and digital paintings I create using an iPad and digital painting software. I like making art on the public internet where anyone can have it. I like using an inkjet printer as a printing press and making real things out of virtual images.

I think a digital painting can be more than pixels on a screen. It can be responsive, filling its rectangular container. It can respond to your touch or your mouse.

## Hi, I'm Michael Barrett

I completed a Master of Fine Arts at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I found my way into a software development career, working primarily as a front-end engineer but also working with web service and API development in Java, C#, and Python.

I have worked extensively with cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and has worked with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Lately, I likes to say ["JAMstack"](https://jamstack.org/) in meetings to see if anyone notices.

## This site

This site is a static website, hand coded using the NextJS AND ReactJS frameworks. It should work reasonably well in modern browsers, excluding Microsoft Edge.

I prefer [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my JavaScript editor on macOS. I prefer [Procreate](https://procreate.art/) on the iPad for painting. I prefer [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) on macOS for creating web graphics. [PixelmatorPro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) is pretty nice too.
