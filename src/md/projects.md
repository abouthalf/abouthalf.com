# Projects

I think a digital painting can be more than pixels on a screen. It can be responsive, filling its rectangular container. It can respond to your touch or your mouse. I like to experiment with digital paintings-as-websites which are slightly interactive.

These projects should work reasonably well in most modern web browsers, excluding Microsoft Edge.

_Foggy Mirror_ recreates the experience of a fogged bathroom mirror using your device’s front-facing camera. Draw with the mouse (or your finger on touch devices) to remove the fog.
